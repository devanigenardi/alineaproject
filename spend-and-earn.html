					<strong>Membership Rewards® Program for Checking and Debit</strong><br/><br/>
					When you open an American Express® Business Checking Account on behalf of a business or an American Express® Rewards Checking Account, you will also receive a Membership Rewards® Account, in which you will earn one Membership Rewards point for every two dollars of eligible Debit Card purchases. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do not include fees or interest charges, cash advances and cash equivalents, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of  prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards or person-to-person transactions.<br/><br/>
					Currently, you can only redeem Membership Rewards points for a deposit into your checking account. However, if you also have a Rewards Account in connection with a Card Account, your Rewards Accounts can be linked and you will have access to all redemption options offered with that Card Account. For more information, visit <a href="http://membershiprewards.com/terms">membershiprewards.com/terms</a>.
