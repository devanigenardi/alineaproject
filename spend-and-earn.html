			<li>
				<p>Terms and Conditions for the Membership Rewards<sup>®</sup> program apply. Visit <a href="http://membershiprewards.com/terms">membershiprewards.com/terms</a> for more information. Participating partners and available rewards are subject to change without notice.</p>
				<p>The value of Membership Rewards points varies according to how you choose to use them. To learn more, go to <a href="http://www.membershiprewards.com/pointsinfo">www.membershiprewards.com/pointsinfo</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>iOS and Android only. See app store listings for operating system info.</p>
				<p>The American Express<sup>&reg;</sup> App and app features are available only for eligible Card accounts in the United States. American Express<sup>&reg;</sup> prepaid Cards and Cards issued by non-American Express issuers are not eligible. To log in, Card Members must have an American Express user ID and password or create one in the app.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Eligible Card Members can redeem an Amex Offer by first enrolling in the offer in their online account or in the American Express<sup>&reg;</sup> App and then using their enrolled Card to pay. Only U.S.-issued American Express Consumer and Business Cards and registered American Express Serve<sup>&reg;</sup> and Bluebird cards may be eligible. We may consider the number of American Express Cards you have opened and closed as well as other factors in making a decision on your eligibility to access Amex Offers. You may not be eligible to access Amex Offers if we, in our sole discretion, determine that you have previously engaged in abuse, misuse or gaming of the Amex Offers program, or any other Amex program. Available offers may vary for each eligible Card Member. Please review the terms of each offer for details on how to redeem. For full Program Terms, visit <a href="https://www.amexoffers.com/partnerterms">amexoffers.com/partnerterms</a>.</p></li>
			<li><p><strong>This offer is available online only to Basic Card Members.</strong> Please allow 8–12 weeks for the Referral Bonus to post to your account after each referred individual is approved for the Card. You cannot earn a Referral Bonus for those who currently have the Card you recommended or for individuals who have been referred by someone else. Due to the confidential nature of the credit approval process, you will not be notified of whether we approve or decline any application(s) from individual(s) you refer. Also, the individuals you refer may not receive the referral email if they have previously “opted out” of receiving email marketing communications from American Express. Any violation or abuse of this program may result in the forfeiture of the Referral Bonus. In order to receive the Referral Bonus, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment. Terms & restrictions of the rewards program corresponding to your Card account apply. NOTE: The value of the Referral Bonus may be taxable income to you; <strong>you are responsible for any federal or state taxes resulting from the Referral Bonus</strong>. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions about the tax treatment of the Referral Bonus.</p></li>
